# Conversion vers ALEXI

- pull documents from ALEXI_URL
  - add links back to PDF (with page number) inside ALEXI documents and
    extract them as well
  - at runtime all we care about are ALEXI URLs and the plain text inside them
  - everything else can be retrieved from the HTML
- index documents
  - we can crawl ALEXI and just get everything from the HTML.  Why not.
